This repository is split into three parts. The first part being 'Building a Language Model.ipynb'. This notebook consists of sentence and ngram generation given a selected corpus. The corpora can be found in the corpus subfolder. Probability, perplexity and linear interpolation of the UNK, Laplace and Vanilla unigrams, bigrams and trigrams are also calculated in this notebook.

The second part with the notebook 'Speech Recognition.ipynb' consists of builing a K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm in order to recognize speech from different English dialects.

The third part consists of experimentations in the attempts of finding an optimal solution for text tagging.
